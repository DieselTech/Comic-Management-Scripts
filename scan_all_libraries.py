Description:
This will queue up all the libraries on your kavita install to scan. If you have a lot of libraries added this can take some time. According to the server logs there could also be a 3 hour delay before a scan starts. 

Software requirements:
- Python 3 or later
- requests
- json

Usage:
python scan_all_libraries.py
